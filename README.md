# CAGE — Custom AI Generation Engine

## Overview

CAGE is a framework that enables you to build your own AI agent quickly and flexibly. The core architecture of the chatbot is already in place. You only need to supply your own data and adjust parameters to tailor the agent’s behavior. This allows you to create an AI tailored to your use case, without having to build everything from scratch.

## Key Features

- Modular architecture so you can replace or extend parts (e.g. data loader, prompt templates, memory).
- Configurable parameters for model selection, prompt design, and response control.
- Easy integration of domain knowledge or datasets to guide agent responses.
- Clean separation between core logic and customization layers.
- Developer-friendly: minimal boilerplate required to get started.
