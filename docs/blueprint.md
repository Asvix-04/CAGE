# **App Name**: AgentForge

## Core Features:

- Data Upload & Processing: Allow users to upload their specific data (text, documents, etc.) to train the custom AI agent.
- Parameter Definition: Enable users to define key parameters such as tone, response length, areas of expertise, and knowledge boundaries to shape the agent's behavior. A tool can assist in deciding if it should limit its response according to those parameters.
- Instant Agent Generation: Automatically generate the custom AI agent based on uploaded data and defined parameters.
- Testing and Preview: Allow users to test and preview their generated AI agent with example prompts before finalizing.
- Agent Customization: Provide options to customize the agent's name, avatar, and introductory message.
- Context retention: Use session cookies to help the bot retain context from earlier messages in the session
